# Introduction
Hello future colleague!

First of all, I would like to take a moment to say thank you for a very enjoyable and 
*relevant* technical test. Too often interviews test for skills that aren't actually relevant 
in context of the day job, however I feel that this test has been a fair representation of
what is likely to be expected in context of the day to day of a Senior Android Engineer. 

Below are the state of each of the challenges for your review in the form of a PR (or 2) per challenge.
Please note that branches have NOT been deleted in case you would like to check a particular branch out 
to facilitate your review process. 

Don't forget to add your apiKey to your local.properties before attempting to build the project locally!

Given context of this particular role, I would strongly recommend the following as a potential repo of interest:
https://github.com/marctatham/message-bottle-android. This is a Work-In-Progress that is going to be a simple app 
that allows people to send a message anonymously into a virtual bottle for someone else to collect.
